# CSS Art: Earth Day
This project is dedicated to Earth Day with intention to participate in [dev challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-next-frontend-challenge-earth-day-edition-52e4). 

## Assets

- svg of earth map was gotten from [fla shop](https://www.fla-shop.com);
- other elements were created by pure CSS.

## Idea
- our Earth switches places with fire Earth - global warming is the main danger for us and our planet. The increase in global temperature effects all aspects of environment.
- Fog in the bottom - it reprents future and oblivion. The animation starts with fire Earth being in possible future and ends with our Earth in oblivion.
- spaceship path - it's possible that in future humanity will need to find a place to live. However, there is no garantee that such place exists - spaceship rushes from "one side" of universe to another and can't find a place to settle. In the end, it returns to our Earth since we need to care about our beatiful planet and ecology has to be the priority of the whole world.
